My name is Andy Hopkins.

I fix bugs and implement features.

I enjoy learning all things tech, teaching what I know to other students, and spreading the word that Svelte is a vastly superior framework to React.

Check out my current portfolio site at www.hopkinsandy.com!  I challenged myself to make a SPA app with zero JavaScript!  (Though I did end up using a single function for a loader).  I'm quite proud of the custom Beziers for the page transitions, and the calligraphic SVG animation I wrote by hand.
